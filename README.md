# Overload
Overload is my first ever released game! Its a local-multiplayer turn-based strategy game where two players duel each other using everything in their arsenal ranging from tactical weapons like EMPs, photon shields, to aggressive weapons such as lasers, Ice Core and even nukes
 
 Made using:
  - Unity Game Engine.
  - C# programming engine.
  - Bfxr for sound effects.
  - Aseprite for pixel art.
